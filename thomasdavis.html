        <p>Hired to take EFF&#39;s campaigning to the next level by building an action centre in Ruby on Rails. The action centre is built around some large open source tools that lower the barrier to entry when contacting congress.</p>

        <p>Worked on many politically charged campaigns against mass surveillance. Our latest project was &quot;TheDayWeFightBack&quot; and I worked on all areas of it. The campaign resulted in 37,000,000 banner views, 100,000 phone calls, ~500,000 emails and ~250,000 signatures. I work mostly in the frontend and also running the Heroku servers which are cached by Cloudfront.</p>
